So this tool asks the review server rather than a checkout. Six ways in, one per call. issue with a Forge number searches every commit message for it. change with a Change-Id or a change number, or commit with a hash out of a checkout, reads that one change. query and path search by words in the commit message and by repository path, and open narrows both to what is still under review. backlog enumerates the open changes, oldest pushed or longest untouched, narrowed by size, vote state, whether they still merge, branch, date and person. Every change carries its identity, status, current patch set, size, age and label state. One read by name adds its message and paths, votes, comments, relation chain and its Change-Id siblings. It adds the Forge issues its trailers name, the other changes its review log names, and whether it carries conflict markers. Four of those decide what a session does and no checkout has them. chain, with chainedAt for the patch set each link sits on. mergeable, which predicts the conflict before the fetch. fetch.ref, which git fetch takes as it stands. And the commit message body. path is the way in for "does somebody already work on this file" and for "has anybody attempted this before". The earlier attempt comes back whatever its name was. You read the diff itself in a checkout: fetch.ref gets you there, and files says how much of the file list to carry. An empty answer says whether it means an absence, since a private change is invisible to an anonymous read. The issue itself is typo3_forge_lookup. This tool reads only: you review, vote and upload yourself.';
