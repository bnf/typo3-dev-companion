``typo3_gerrit_lookup``
=======================

*Find a patch under review*

Whether a TYPO3 core patch already exists and what state its review is in, read
from review.typo3.org. A clone carries what landed and says nothing about what
is open. So this tool asks the review server rather than a checkout. Six ways
in, one per call. issue with a Forge number searches every commit message for
it. change with a Change-Id or a change number, or commit with a hash out of a
checkout, reads that one change. query and path search by words in the commit
message and by repository path, and open narrows both to what is still under
review. backlog enumerates the open changes, oldest pushed or longest untouched,
narrowed by size, vote state, whether they still merge, branch, date and person.
Every change carries its identity, status, current patch set, size, age and
label state. One read by name adds its message and paths, votes, comments,
relation chain and its Change-Id siblings. It adds the Forge issues its trailers
name, the other changes its review log names, and whether it carries conflict
markers. Four of those decide what a session does and no checkout has them.
chain, with chainedAt for the patch set each link sits on. mergeable, which
predicts the conflict before the fetch. fetch.ref, which git fetch takes as it
stands. And the commit message body. path is the way in for "does somebody
already work on this file" and for "has anybody attempted this before". The
earlier attempt comes back whatever its name was. You read the diff itself in a
checkout: fetch.ref gets you there, and files says how much of the file list to
carry. An empty answer says whether it means an absence, since a private change
is invisible to an anonymous read. The issue itself is typo3_forge_lookup. This
tool reads only: you review, vote and upload yourself. Answers from: network.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Forge issue number, for example 105403. Searches every change whose commit
    # message names it, which is where Resolves: and Related: put it. Not with
    # change, commit, query, path or backlog.
    issue: integer  # optional
    # One change to read, by the Change-Id its commit message carries or by the
    # change number, or by the review URL itself. For example
    # "I0f4c5b9a3e2d1c7b8a6f5e4d3c2b1a0f9e8d7c6b", "89011" or
    # "https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/89011". Prefer the Change-Id
    # where the commit is in front of you. It is part of the patch and it survives
    # an amend. A bare change number looks like a Forge issue number, and a
    # Change-Id cannot. Not with issue, commit, query, path or backlog.
    change: string  # optional
    # A commit hash out of a checkout, abbreviated as git log prints it or whole,
    # for example "cf227b18e20". Answers the change that commit is a patch set of,
    # with the changes that share its Change-Id. That is how a hash in your own
    # history reaches the backports beside it and the branches each targets. Pass a
    # hash here rather than as change. There the review server answers "Invalid
    # change format" to it, which arrives as a server that does not answer at all.
    # Not with issue, change, query, path or backlog.
    commit: string  # optional
    # Words to search the review server for, for example "impexp translation". Every
    # word has to appear. The search matches the commit message, subject and body,
    # so it finds a change whose subject lacks the word. It does not match the diff:
    # change 89000 added writePagesOrder and a search for that name answers nothing.
    # So a zero says no commit message names the word. Ask again in the words a
    # commit message uses, or pass path for the changes that touch a file, whatever
    # their names. Combine with path to narrow one by the other, and with open for
    # what is still under review. Not with issue, change, commit or backlog.
    query: string  # optional
    # A path in the repository, for example "typo3/sysext/impexp" or
    # "typo3/sysext/impexp/Classes/Import.php". Answers the changes that touch it,
    # the path itself and everything under it. A change matches by the paths its own
    # patch set touches, so a directory the branch has since renamed still answers
    # the changes from before the rename, and nothing here says whether the path
    # exists on the branch today. With open it asks whether somebody works on a file
    # now, before you write a patch for it. Without open it reaches the abandoned
    # and merged changes too, where an earlier attempt at the same fix sits. Combine
    # with query to narrow one by the other. Not with issue, change, commit or
    # backlog.
    path: string  # optional
    # Narrow a search to the changes still under review. False, the default, reaches
    # every state, which "has anybody ever tried this" needs, since an abandoned or
    # merged attempt answers it. True is "who works on this now". Narrows query and
    # path; issue, change and commit ignore it.
    open: boolean  # optional
    # One of: auto, none, stat, full. How much of the file list a change read by
    # name carries. "auto", the default, prints a line per file up to 40 of them,
    # and beyond that a count with the top-level directories. 40 is the ninetieth
    # percentile of an open core change. So an ordinary patch keeps its list, and a
    # refactor of 137 files does not spend the answer on one. "stat" is that count
    # whatever the size, and "full" the whole list whatever the size. "none" leaves
    # it out, which is what a caller with the fetch ref in hand and git diff next
    # wants. The hunks are in none of them: the ref is what reads content. Narrows
    # change and commit; every other way in ignores it.
    files: string  # optional
    # One of: none, people, all. The review log of a change: every message its patch
    # sets and its reviewers left. Ask for it to find out why a vote is gone. Gerrit
    # writes "Outdated Votes: * Code-Review+1 (copy condition: ...)" into the
    # message of the upload that dropped it. The labels afterwards look like a
    # change nobody has voted on. "none" leaves it out and is the default, since it
    # is 57.9 KB against 14.3 KB on a change with 21 patch sets. "people" drops what
    # a service user wrote — 20 of 46 messages on that change, every one a CI
    # pipeline report. "all" keeps them. The answer says how many it dropped, and
    # whether the current patch set carries git conflict markers, whichever you ask
    # for. Narrows change and commit; every other way in ignores it.
    messages: string  # optional
    # One of: oldest, stale. Enumerate the open changes of the TYPO3 core instead of
    # a read of one or a match of words. "oldest" orders them by push date, "stale"
    # by how long nobody has touched them. Pushed long ago is about the patch,
    # untouched for months about the attention it got. A change that is both is what
    # a review session looks for. The filters beside it are what "small", "has
    # votes" and "still applies" mean: maxSize, minCodeReview, negativeVotes and
    # mergeable. The answer leaves out the changes their own authors marked work in
    # progress, since a draft is not up for review; query says so. maxSize,
    # minCodeReview, negativeVotes, mergeable, branch, updatedBefore, owner,
    # reviewedBy, involving and reviewableBy narrow this way in and no other. Not
    # with issue, change, commit, query or path.
    backlog: string  # optional
    # Only changes whose insertions and deletions add up to at most this, for
    # example 60. That is what "small in scope" comes to, and it decides whether a
    # review fits into a session at all.
    maxSize: integer  # optional
    # Only changes somebody holds at least this Code-Review vote on. 1 is a change a
    # reviewer has been through once, 2 is one with approval. With negativeVotes
    # false this is "almost ready": somebody is for it and nobody against.
    minCodeReview: integer  # optional
    # Whether changes that carry a Code-Review-1 or a Verified-1 are in the answer.
    # True, the default, keeps them. False drops both — a reviewer who objects and
    # a pipeline that fails, the two reasons a change is not one to pick up now.
    negativeVotes: boolean  # optional
    # True answers only the changes that still merge into their target branch. It is
    # the review server's own last computation and not a merge run now. So it says
    # which changes are worth a fetch and promises nothing about whether one
    # applies. False, the default, keeps every change. The ones that no longer merge
    # are usually the oldest, which makes an unfiltered "oldest first" page a list
    # of conflicts.
    mergeable: boolean  # optional
    # Only changes that target this branch, spelled as the branch is: "main",
    # "13.4". Set it when the checkout in front of you is on one line. You read a
    # patch for another branch against code you do not have.
    branch: string  # optional
    # Only changes nobody has touched since this day, as YYYY-MM-DD. It finds the
    # review everybody has walked past, which age alone does not. A change pushed in
    # 2023 and commented on last week is in work. It reads the last update and never
    # the push date. The review server indexes no created date, which is also why
    # this server orders backlog "oldest" itself.
    updatedBefore: string  # optional
    # Only changes this person pushed, by name or e-mail address: "Benjamin Kott",
    # "benjamin.kott@outlook.com", or part of either. This answers "which open
    # changes are mine", which query cannot. query matches the commit message, and a
    # name there is as often somebody else who wrote it. The review server resolves
    # the name; a name it does not know answers no changes, which looks exactly like
    # a person with none.
    owner: string  # optional
    # Only changes this person has voted on, resolved the same way as owner. The
    # other half of a person and a different question. What somebody pushed is
    # theirs to finish; what they voted on is theirs to have judged already.
    reviewedBy: string  # optional
    # Only changes this person is on either side of — pushed or voted on, as one
    # set. Pass it instead of owner and reviewedBy, not beside them: those two
    # together mean pushed AND voted on, a set nobody wants.
    involving: string  # optional
    # Only changes this person neither pushed nor has voted on, named the same way
    # as owner. That is "which of these could I review": everybody else's open work
    # minus what I have already judged. You cannot combine the three filters above
    # into it, since each of them selects. It reads no permissions: it takes out
    # this person's own changes and votes. It composes with the three that select:
    # owner with this one is what somebody else could review of a third person's
    # queue. The same name here and on involving answers nothing. A name the review
    # server cannot place takes nothing out and answers the whole backlog, the
    # opposite of what a misspelt name does to owner. Check it against a change of
    # theirs before you read a wide answer as "nothing of theirs is in here".
    reviewableBy: string  # optional
    # How many changes come back from a search or the backlog. A change read by name
    # is one answer whatever this says.
    limit: integer  # optional

The call carries exactly one of these sets of arguments:

- ``issue``
- ``change``
- ``commit``
- ``query``
- ``path``
- ``backlog``

Recorded on 2026-10-05 by ``bin/cli tools:record``. Answered against
core-checkout, TYPO3 15.0.0-dev, the main core checkout below .checkouts/. Its
console is out of reach: <installation> has no TYPO3 console — none of
bin/typo3, vendor/bin/typo3 exists. Its dependencies are not installed —
vendor/autoload.php is not there either, and composer install writes both.
Nothing checks what is below this heading; everything above it is derived from
the class that answers the call, and ``bin/cli tools:check`` holds it.

    A `Releases:` line is the author's claim about which branches the patch belongs on, written before it went to any of them. What was pushed is the changes above sharing a Change-Id, one per branch and each with a status of its own — so a branch the trailer names with no change targeting it is a backport nobody has pushed, and a merged change is on its branch whatever the trailer says. Which release carries it is neither: that is the first release cut from the branch after the change merged, which this server does not read.

    The branches that take a patch today, whichever one the change above targets: main is the development line, which every core change is written against first; 14.3 is in regular support until 2029-06-30; 13.4 is in regular support until 2027-12-31. Read from https://get.typo3.org/api/v1/major/ on 2026-08-05; a core clone carries no such list, since "git branch -r" reaches back to TYPO3_3-6 and says nothing about which of those is still maintained. Which of these a change belongs on is the author's claim rather than a consequence of the list — `typo3_commit_message_guide` with `workflow="core"` is what reads a `Releases:` trailer against them.

    Hold the commit against `git rev-parse HEAD` in the checkout. Where the two differ, the checkout is not the revision under review, and a review says which of the two it read.

    The fetch goes to the review server rather than to `origin`: a core clone fetches from the GitHub mirror, where `refs/changes/…` does not exist. `git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD` is what puts the checkout on the patch set afterwards.

    ### Issues named in the commit message (1)
    - resolves #106535 — Task · Closed · Raise --dev phpunit/phpunit:^11.5.17 -w · https://forge.typo3.org/issues/106535

    The paths above are what the current patch set touches, and they are the argument the work after this takes: `typo3_hint_lookup` for the conventions of each subsystem in the list, `typo3_test_run_guide` for the suites that can fail on them. What is not here is the diff — the hunks are what a fetch is for, and a shortlist is triaged without fetching anything.

    The issues above are what the commit message names, and a status there is the issue's own rather than this change's. Pass one to `typo3_forge_lookup` as `issue` to read it whole, which is where a maintainer said why something was closed or reassigned.

    A heading above is what its thread stands at: the `unresolved` flag on the last comment in it, which is where Gerrit keeps a thread's state and what it counts beside the change. The flag on one comment is its own writer's, and the data half carries both. Neither is a judgement that a question was answered: a resolved thread can still hold one, and an unresolved thread can carry the reply that settled it. Which of them this review would otherwise make a second time is yours to read.

    A vote a later patch set dropped is absent here rather than zero, and the copy condition that dropped it is written in the review log alone — ask again with `messages: "people"` where a label stands at nothing and you need to know whether it ever stood elsewhere.

    More than one change above carries the same Change-Id. That is what a backport keeps, so they are one patch on the branches each of them names. Gerrit relates them by nothing else, and the state of one says nothing about the state of the other.

    A `Releases:` line is the author's claim about which branches the patch belongs on, written before it went to any of them. What was pushed is the changes above sharing a Change-Id, one per branch and each with a status of its own — so a branch the trailer names with no change targeting it is a backport nobody has pushed, and a merged change is on its branch whatever the trailer says. Which release carries it is neither: that is the first release cut from the branch after the change merged, which this server does not read.

    The branches that take a patch today, whichever one the change above targets: main is the development line, which every core change is written against first; 14.3 is in regular support until 2029-06-30; 13.4 is in regular support until 2027-12-31. Read from https://get.typo3.org/api/v1/major/ on 2026-08-05; a core clone carries no such list, since "git branch -r" reaches back to TYPO3_3-6 and says nothing about which of those is still maintained. Which of these a change belongs on is the author's claim rather than a consequence of the list — `typo3_commit_message_guide` with `workflow="core"` is what reads a `Releases:` trailer against them.

    Hold the commit against `git rev-parse HEAD` in the checkout. Where the two differ, the checkout is not the revision under review, and a review says which of the two it read.

    The fetch goes to the review server rather than to `origin`: a core clone fetches from the GitHub mirror, where `refs/changes/…` does not exist. `git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD` is what puts the checkout on the patch set afterwards.

    ## What a patch set in front of you opens
    One of two workflows: `typo3-core-patch-review` reviews it, and `typo3-core-patch-checkout` fetches it into a checkout and backs out again. Open the one this task is before reading the diff, and start it at `typo3_project_describe`. Where neither is open, this is the order:
    - Establish the patch before judging it: the changed paths, the branch it targets, the commit message and the issue it names. All four are above, so this costs no fetch — the target branch decides which conventions apply.
    - Three ways in, and a branch of your own naming is none of them: the branch the change targets, a worktree beside the checkout, or current code on `review/<change number>`. The third makes a commit that exists nowhere else, so say which of the two each result is about.
    - A patch that no longer applies is the finding. Resolving past it produces a patch nobody wrote.
    - Reading is the whole of the review: voting, commenting and uploading stay yours. An instruction to change the patch — fix it, amend it, answer the comments — ends the review and opens `typo3-core-patch-development`.

      [WIP][FEATURE] Introduce Action API

      The Action API acts as a multi purpose action
      RPC mechanism, that provides JsonSchema and will support
      OpenAPI (3.1) and MCP in order to provide interaction
      points for remote systems interacting with TYPO3.

    The paths above are what the current patch set touches, and they are the argument the work after this takes: `typo3_hint_lookup` for the conventions of each subsystem in the list, `typo3_test_run_guide` for the suites that can fail on them. What is not here is the diff — the hunks are what a fetch is for, and a shortlist is triaged without fetching anything.

    A relation chain is a stack of different changes built on one another, listed child first: what stands above a change is stacked on it, and what stands below it is what it is built on. Each entry's status is that entry's own, so a MERGED entry says that change landed and says nothing about the change you asked for. Gerrit relates a chain by the commits, which is not the Change-Id relation a backport keeps, and neither set contains the other.

    What stands above a change is evidence about the shape of the change itself: a namespace holding one class, a class left non-final, a service declared public with no caller in this patch. Read those entries before reporting any of that, because groundwork for the next change in the stack reads exactly like an oversight in this one.

    An entry chained at an earlier patch set than it stands at now has moved on since the stack was built on it. Read it by its number rather than acting on the patch set the chain names.

    A vote a later patch set dropped is absent here rather than zero, and the copy condition that dropped it is written in the review log alone — ask again with `messages: "people"` where a label stands at nothing and you need to know whether it ever stood elsewhere.

    A `Releases:` line is the author's claim about which branches the patch belongs on, written before it went to any of them. What was pushed is the changes above sharing a Change-Id, one per branch and each with a status of its own — so a branch the trailer names with no change targeting it is a backport nobody has pushed, and a merged change is on its branch whatever the trailer says. Which release carries it is neither: that is the first release cut from the branch after the change merged, which this server does not read.

    The branches that take a patch today, whichever one the change above targets: main is the development line, which every core change is written against first; 14.3 is in regular support until 2029-06-30; 13.4 is in regular support until 2027-12-31. Read from https://get.typo3.org/api/v1/major/ on 2026-08-05; a core clone carries no such list, since "git branch -r" reaches back to TYPO3_3-6 and says nothing about which of those is still maintained. Which of these a change belongs on is the author's claim rather than a consequence of the list — `typo3_commit_message_guide` with `workflow="core"` is what reads a `Releases:` trailer against them.

    Hold the commit against `git rev-parse HEAD` in the checkout. Where the two differ, the checkout is not the revision under review, and a review says which of the two it read.

    The fetch goes to the review server rather than to `origin`: a core clone fetches from the GitHub mirror, where `refs/changes/…` does not exist. `git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD` is what puts the checkout on the patch set afterwards.

    ## What a patch set in front of you opens
    One of two workflows: `typo3-core-patch-review` reviews it, and `typo3-core-patch-checkout` fetches it into a checkout and backs out again. Open the one this task is before reading the diff, and start it at `typo3_project_describe`. Where neither is open, this is the order:
    - Establish the patch before judging it: the changed paths, the branch it targets, the commit message and the issue it names. All four are above, so this costs no fetch — the target branch decides which conventions apply.
    - Three ways in, and a branch of your own naming is none of them: the branch the change targets, a worktree beside the checkout, or current code on `review/<change number>`. The third makes a commit that exists nowhere else, so say which of the two each result is about.
    - A patch that no longer applies is the finding. Resolving past it produces a patch nobody wrote.
    - Reading is the whole of the review: voting, commenting and uploading stay yours. An instruction to change the patch — fix it, amend it, answer the comments — ends the review and opens `typo3-core-patch-development`.

    Query: project:"Packages/TYPO3.CMS" status:open -is:wip delta:<=60 label:Code-Review>=1 -label:Code-Review<=-1 -label:Verified<=-1 is:mergeable
    3 of 36 open core changes, oldest pushed first.
    This is a page and not the set, and limit stops at 25. What comes after it is reached by a narrower filter — a smaller maxSize, a branch, an earlier updatedBefore — rather than by a larger limit, because more of one order is more of the same end.
    Age is a candidate and never a finding. The oldest changes are regularly the largest and the ones that no longer merge, so maxSize and mergeable are what turn this order into a shortlist — and what a change is actually waiting on is read by passing its number back as change, which answers the votes with their voters and the comments with their threads.
    `typo3-core-patch-review` is the workflow a change picked off this page opens, and `typo3-core-patch-checkout` is what gets the patch set into a checkout. Open the one this task is before reading a diff.

    The branches that take a patch today, whichever one the change above targets: main is the development line, which every core change is written against first; 14.3 is in regular support until 2029-06-30; 13.4 is in regular support until 2027-12-31. Read from https://get.typo3.org/api/v1/major/ on 2026-08-05; a core clone carries no such list, since "git branch -r" reaches back to TYPO3_3-6 and says nothing about which of those is still maintained. Which of these a change belongs on is the author's claim rather than a consequence of the list — `typo3_commit_message_guide` with `workflow="core"` is what reads a `Releases:` trailer against them.

    The fetch goes to the review server rather than to `origin`: a core clone fetches from the GitHub mirror, where `refs/changes/…` does not exist. `git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD` is what puts the checkout on the patch set afterwards.
