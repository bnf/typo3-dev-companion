# Discovery — which installation is read, and how

Everything the server reads from an installation that works rests on the search for it first: the packages, the console, the version. A wrong answer here is invisible,
because it looks exactly like an installation that has nothing to say.

See [the decisions readme](../readme.md) for how a session writes an entry and when it adds one.
