# What was decided, and on what evidence

The working directory: one file per decision, in the group its id names. The
listing below and the one at the foot of each group's own `readme.md` are
written by `bin/cli decisions:index`.

What a decision is and what its states mean:
[documentation/records/decisions.rst](../documentation/records/decisions.rst).
Where an entry goes, how one is written and what a later session adds to it:
[documentation/records/writing-a-decision.rst](../documentation/records/writing-a-decision.rst),
which `bin/cli decisions:check` holds every file to.

## Every decision, by group

What is not listed as revoked still holds. `confirmed` marks the ones somebody
went back to and found standing; the rest are open, which is the ordinary case
and not a defect. What was decided lately is `bin/cli decisions:list`.
